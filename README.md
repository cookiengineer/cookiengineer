### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cookie Engineer, and this is me:

:shield: I'm somewhat a Cyber Security Analyst or Engineer with a specialization in `netsec` and `infosec`.

:car: I'm currently working in the automotive industry to make car platforms and their development more
secure in regards to ISO 26262, ISO 21434, and UN Regulation No. 155 and 156.

:computer: My previous work focussed on Blueteam/Purpleteam work, by defending network infrastructures
and by making large-scale computation systems more secure (e.g. ISO 27001, ISO 27033 or IEC 62443).

:abacus: I taught myself programming when I was a child. My love for the 6502 continues, but I learned to set
aside my personal preferences about programming languages over the years. I've realized that humans are bad
at programming, and more restrictions in (opinionated) programming languages usually lead to higher code quality
in the face of code fuzzing or automated exploit code generation.

:heart: I've done a lot of work in `C/C++`, `node.js`, `HTML5/CSS3`, `WebGL` and naturally also in a lot of
shader languages due to my passion for game jams. These days I prefer `golang` wherever possible, though, due
to its strong build ecosystem and some amazing pure golang libraries that allow more efficient `redteaming`.

:robot: I love to work with co-evolutionary [backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/facultybib2000/2178/),
[Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) and [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
based systems to build automated Cyber Defense systems.

:hushed: I'm a 4chan (`/g/`, `/pol/`, `/q/`, `kiwifarms`) discreditation target of 2021, so you'll find lots
of lies about me on the Web, including news websites that apparently never verify their sources.

:rocket: In my free time I'm working on the [Tholian Network](https://tholian.network) which aims to create
a peer-to-peer self-defending network that preserves cryptographic anonymity while enhancing integrity, truth
and transparency in order to tackle lots of the web's problems.

:rainbow: I believe in Human Rights. The [Tholian Network Charter](https://tholian.network/charter.html)
is my attempt of creating guidelines for a cooperative future that embraces the potential of a
mutually helping and understanding society.

Live long and prosper. :vulcan_salute:
