### Hello ðŸ‘‹

![cookiengineer](./cookiengineer.jpg)

I'm Cookie Engineer, and this is me:

:shield: I'm a Cyber Security Analyst / Pentest Engineer with a specialization in `netsec` and `infosec`.
I do a lot of binary exploitation CTFs, but I'm still pretty bad at it.

:rocket: I'm working on the [Tholian Network](https://tholian.network) which aims to create
a peer-to-peer self-adapting Cyber Defense Network intelligently fights back against APT botnets.

:computer: Previously I did Blueteam/Purpleteam work, by defending network infrastructures
and by making large-scale computation systems more secure (e.g. ISO 27001, ISO 27033 or IEC 62443, ISO 21434,
ISO 26262, UN Regulations No 155/156 and NIS2).

:abacus: I started programming when I was 8, on the 6502. My first soldering experience was the Turbo and 128k Mod,
that I did at the age of 9. I learned a ton along the way, and I've realized a long time ago that humans are bad at
programming. I think that more restrictions in opinionate) programming languages lead to higher code quality in the
face of code fuzzing, automated exploit code generation, and overly complex systems. The best programming language
is the one with the least maintenance burden.

:heart: My preferred languages are `Go`, `eBPF`, and `WebASM`. But I've done a lot of work in `C`, `C++`, `NASM`,
`node.js`, `RAPID`, `SPS`, `JerryScript`, `V8GL`, `HTML5`, `CSS4`, `WebGL`, `Rust`, `Lua`, `Nidium` and other runtimes
due to my passion for electronics, robotics, and game jams.

:robot: I love to automate code generation with co-evolutionary [backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/facultybib2000/2178/),
[Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) and [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
based systems to build automated Cyber Defense systems.

:hushed: I'm a 4chan (`/g/`, `/pol/`, `/q/`, `kiwifarms`) discreditation target of 2021, so you'll find lots
of lies about me on the Web, including news websites that apparently never verify their sources before publishing
clickbaity stories.

:rainbow: I believe in Human Rights. The [Tholian Network Charter](https://tholian.network/charter.html)
is my attempt of creating guidelines for a cooperative future that embraces the potential of a
mutually helping and understanding society.

Live long and prosper. :vulcan_salute:
