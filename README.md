### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cookie Engineer, and this is me:

- :zap: Cyber Security Analyst with a background in netsec.
- :car: I'm working in the Automotive Industry to make car platforms more secure (ISO 26262, ISO 21434, UN Regulation No. 155-157).
- :hushed: 4Chan Discreditation Target 2021, so you'll find lots of lies about me on the Internet.
- :star: In my free time I'm working on the [Tholian Network](https://github.com/tholian-network) which aims to create a Peer-to-Peer Web
  Browser Network with Cryptographic Anonymity while enhancing Integrity and Transparency to tackle lots of the Web's problems, including
  defamation attempts by Internet Trolls and other (state-level) actors that abuse the power of unverifiable sources.
- :rainbow: I believe in Human Rights. The [Tholian Network Charter](https://tholian.network/charter.html) is my attempt
  of creating guidelines for a cooperative future that embraces the potential of a mutually helping society.

Live long and prosper. :vulcan_salute:
