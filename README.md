### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cookie Engineer, and this is me:

- :shield: Cyber Security Analyst with a background in `netsec` and `infosec`.
- :car: I'm working in the Automotive Industry to make car platforms more secure (e.g. ISO 26262, ISO 21434, UN Regulation No. 155-157).
- :computer: My previous work focussed on Blueteam/Purpleteam SOC work, making network infrastructures and large-scale computation systems more secure (e.g. ISO 27001, ISO 27033).
- :robot: For `netint` and `osint` tasks I love to work with co-evolutionary [backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/facultybib2000/2178/), [Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) and [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641) based systems.
- :hushed: I'm a 4Chan Discreditation Target of 2021, so you'll find lots of lies about me on the Internet.
- :rocket: In my free time I'm working on the [Tholian Network](https://github.com/tholian-network) which aims to create a peer-to-peer Web
  Browser network with cryptographic anonymity while enhancing Integrity and Transparency to tackle lots of the Web's problems, including
  defamation attempts by Internet Trolls and politically directed Emotional Mobs.
- :rainbow: I believe in Human Rights. The [Tholian Network Charter](https://tholian.network/charter.html) is my attempt
  of creating guidelines for a cooperative future that embraces the potential of a mutually helping society.

Live long and prosper. :vulcan_salute:
