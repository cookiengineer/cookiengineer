### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cookie Engineer, and this is me:

:shield: I'm somewhat a Cyber Security Analyst or Engineer with a specialization in `netsec` and `infosec`.

:car: I'm currently working in the Automotive Industry to make car platforms and their development more
secure in regards to ISO 26262, ISO 21434, and UN Regulation No. 155 and 156.

:computer: My previous companies focussed on Blueteam/Purpleteam work, by defending network infrastructures
and by making large-scale computation systems more secure (e.g. ISO 27001, ISO 27033).

:robot: I love to work with co-evolutionary [backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/facultybib2000/2178/),
[Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) and [Compositional Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04641)
based systems to build automated Cyber Defense systems.

:hushed: I'm a 4chan (`/g/`, `/pol/`, `/q/`) discreditation target of 2021, so you'll find lots of lies
about me on the Web, including news websites that apparently never verify their sources.

:rocket: In my free time I'm working on the [Tholian Network](https://github.com/tholian-network)
which aims to create a peer-to-peer intelligence network which preserves cryptographic anonymity while
enhancing integrity, truth and transparency in order to tackle lots of the Web's problems.

:rainbow: I believe in Human Rights. The [Tholian Network Charter](https://tholian.network/charter.html)
is my attempt of creating guidelines for a cooperative future that embraces the potential of a
mutually helping and understanding society.

Live long and prosper. :vulcan_salute:
